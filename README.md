# OZ-solvers
(In development)

Codes in different languages for solving Ornstein-Zernike equation using the Picard iteration method.

The Fourier transforms are computed according to: Lado, F. (1971). Numerical fourier transforms in one, two, and three dimensions for liquid state calculations. Journal of Computational Physics, 8(3), 417-433.

For more details one may check the following references in which it is given a description of how this method works:
