  - Picard iteration method;
    - [x] MATLAB
    - [x] Python
    - [x] C
  - Modified Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (MDIIS) method.
    - [x] MATLAB
    - [x] Python
    - [ ] C

* Solving 1D Reference Interaction Site Model (1D-RISM) using the MDIIS method.
  - [x] MATLAB
  - [ ] Python
  - [ ] C

## Tecnical details

The Fourier transforms are computed according to [1]. For more details of how those methods works, one may check the references [2-4].
